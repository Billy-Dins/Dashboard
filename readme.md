## Odin Project
This page was built using [The Odin Project curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard)
The intent of this project was to recreate the referenced webpage [here](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/43cc6ab69fdfbef40d431a65677d2144668930ac/intermediate_html_css/grid/project_admin_dashboard/imgs/dashboard-project.png) with emphasis on grid and nesting grid elements.

## Challenges
This was a first attempt at building a webpage with it's structure based on CSS Grid as opposed to flexbox. Just like with flexbox, the syntax is very inuitive once you have exposure to it, however distinguishing between the parent and child roles and how to refer to each was quite frustrating at first.
Additionally, figuring out when looking at a provided web page, which parts of a grid-template some elements belong to was difficult without having much prior exposure.

## Good points
Prior to this project, I did not understand the implementation to Icons and really what an SVG was. I think the desired outcome came out almost as I wanted it to, however more practice is necessary as the icons tend to be a common point within most web pages.
